# NY Times Google Calendar

## Description

The motivation and purpose behind this project was to create a site where you can view the best selling books of any week the user selects. It solves the issue of not only having a quick and easy to use database, but it's also easy on the eyes and accessible.

We learned a lot about using different APIs and how we can make them work together.  We also learned a lot about using Bulma to style our webpage.

## Usage

Link to deployed url: 

To use, all you have to do is select a date from the drop-down calendar. The top five non-fiction and top five fiction books of that week will then populate onto the page. Under the books image, you'll then see the books title, author, and description of the book. Each card is also fit with an Amazon link, so the user can purchase the book!
